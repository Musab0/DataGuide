BEST PRACTICES FOR DATA MANAGEMENT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLICATIONS
===================================
NATIONAL PROGRAM FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

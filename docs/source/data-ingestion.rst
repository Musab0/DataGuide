2.1	SOURCES OF DATA
In recent years, businesses and organisations have been moving more and more processes and services online. These digital processes generate a huge amount of data every second. We can group these data into three distinct categories:

1.	Sensor-generated data (i.e., Internet of Things [IoT] data). These data are generated by equipment without human involvement, such as smart meters, road sensors, street cameras, satellites and many more sources. This type of data source extends our capability of sensing and monitoring the world around us, which, in turn, helps us in automatic decision-making through the analysis of these data. Self-driving cars are a good example of such systems, as they automatically analyse data to navigate their environment and drive autonomously.
2.	User-generated data. Online user-generated data include informal content posted by individuals on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, forums, blogs and other mediums of communication, as well as more formal content in newspapers, news agencies, government media outlets, public information websites and so forth. It is worth noting that social media outlets such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are also being used by government and news agencies as a formal mode of information sharing. This kind of data provides invaluable insights into people’s and communities’ views, per- ception and behaviour, as well as what is happening in the world and the impact on opinions, needs and actions.
3.	Transaction data. Such data are generated from human actions (e.g., invoices, payment orders, storage records, delivery receipts, ordering a passport online). Analysis of this type of data together with other sup- porting types provides a more comprehensive situational awareness and highlights the consequences of events that are taking place. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic results in lower transactions in terms of physical shopping and increased online shopping. COVID-19 has also resulted in certain goods like masks being more in demand than fuel.
